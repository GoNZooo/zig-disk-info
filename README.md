# Why?

I needed an excuse to make something in Zig (this was my first project in it)
and coincidentally needed a way to see my hard drive usage without waiting for
Windows to calculate it.

I end up using it probably at least a few times a week so it's been useful.

## Usage

Open the app, see how much disk space you have left. Click on the entries to
open the disk in the file explorer.
