# Why?

I needed an excuse to make something in Zig and coincidentally needed a way to
see my hard drive usage without waiting for Windows to calculate it.

I end up using it probably at least a few times a week so it's been useful.

## Usage

Open the app, see how much disk space you have left. Click on the entries to
open the disk in the file explorer.
